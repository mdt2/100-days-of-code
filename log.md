# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1 Log

### Day 1: September 7, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Did a lot of reading. Created a random password generator with Javascript to get back in the swing of things.

**Thoughts** I will not let imposter syndrome overwhelm me this time!

### Day 2: September 8, Friday

**Today's Progress**: "Gathering context" with ABC course, learned about Vue.js.

**Thoughts** Vue.js is really fast and easy to set up.

### Day 3: September 9, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about JS event loop, FreeCodeCamp factorialize a number exercise (not using recursion)

**Thoughts** I'd like to try to redo the factorial exercise with recursion and learn more about that.

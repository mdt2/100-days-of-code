# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1 Log

### Day 1: September 7, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Did a lot of reading. Created a random password generator with Javascript to get back in the swing of things.

**Thoughts** I will not let imposter syndrome overwhelm me this time!

### Day 2: September 8, Friday

**Today's Progress**: "Gathering context" with ABC course, learned about Vue.js.

**Thoughts** Vue.js is really fast and easy to set up.

### Day 3: September 9, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about JS event loop, FreeCodeCamp factorialize a number exercise (not using recursion)

**Thoughts** I'd like to try to redo the factorial exercise with recursion and learn more about that.

### Day 4: September 10, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Redid FreeCodeCamp with recursion. Worked a FreeCodeCamp regular expressions problem.

**Thoughts**: Recursion reminds me a little of JS event loop in the way that it goes all the way into something and then all the way back out. "There's nothing that HAS to be solved with recursion." Regular expressions are really challenging right now, so I need to revisit eventually.

### Day 5-6: September 12, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through more FreeCodeCamp basic algorithm writing and read Chapter 1 of Problem Solving 101.

**Thoughts**: Had some frustration today during algorithm practice. I think Problem Solving 101 will be a good way to get into a permanent, whole mindset of problem solving.


### Day 7: September 13, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Rejoined Treehouse and started the React basics course. Also read Chapter 1 of Eloquent JS.

**Thoughts** There's a lot more to Javascript than I realized, Eloquent JS will be a good way to expose myself to some computer science information I may not otherwise see.

### Day 8: September 14, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued React.js course on Treehouse.

**Thoughts** React's layout is very different from any other language or framework I've seen. Interested to learn more.


### Day 9: September 15, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Watched some Fun Fun Function videos about dev habits and DevTips on what to learn next, jQuery, and how to keep up a web presence with my work.

**Thoughts** Feeling pretty sick and tired with a cold today so I'm taking it easy. Frustration is normal and it's there to help, gotta perservere. Have to make sure I'm not too bored or challenging myself to a point where I'm stressed. Find the "flow" state

### Day 10: September 16, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started random quote machine project from FreeCodeCamp. Learning about connecting to APIs using jQuery.

**Thoughts** Using jQuery AJAX shortcut since native JS is messy.

### Day 14: September 20, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Watched DevTips bootstrap.

**Thoughts** Need to start working on coding earlier so I'm not so sleepy.


### Day 15: September 21, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript30 Day 1, drumkit.

**Thoughts** Need to figure out how to structure my learning with JS30 so that I'm applying myself more. Coding with him doesn't seem to work.


### Day 16: September 22, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Eloquent JS chapter 3.

### Day 17: September 23, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: JS clock for Javascript30 Day 2.

**Thoughts** I'm trying to recreate the start files to challenge myself with these projects more. Maybe I'll make a digital clock after I'm done working through the analog clock exercise.


### Day 18: September 24, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the JS clock.

**Thoughts** Shouldn't work in codepen for JS projects in the future.

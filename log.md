# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1 Log

### Day 1: September 7, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Did a lot of reading. Created a random password generator with Javascript to get back in the swing of things.

**Thoughts** I will not let imposter syndrome overwhelm me this time!

### Day 2: September 8, Friday

**Today's Progress**: "Gathering context" with ABC course, learned about Vue.js.

**Thoughts** Vue.js is really fast and easy to set up.

### Day 3: September 9, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about JS event loop, FreeCodeCamp factorialize a number exercise (not using recursion)

**Thoughts** I'd like to try to redo the factorial exercise with recursion and learn more about that.

### Day 4: September 10, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Redid FreeCodeCamp with recursion. Worked a FreeCodeCamp regular expressions problem.

**Thoughts**: Recursion reminds me a little of JS event loop in the way that it goes all the way into something and then all the way back out. "There's nothing that HAS to be solved with recursion." Regular expressions are really challenging right now, so I need to revisit eventually.

### Day 5-6: September 12, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through more FreeCodeCamp basic algorithm writing and read Chapter 1 of Problem Solving 101.

**Thoughts**: Had some frustration today during algorithm practice. I think Problem Solving 101 will be a good way to get into a permanent, whole mindset of problem solving.


### Day 7: September 13, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Rejoined Treehouse and started the React basics course. Also read Chapter 1 of Eloquent JS.

**Thoughts** There's a lot more to Javascript than I realized, Eloquent JS will be a good way to expose myself to some computer science information I may not otherwise see.

1. [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html)


### Day 8: September 14, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued React.js course on Treehouse.

**Thoughts** React's layout is very different from any other language or framework I've seen. Interested to learn more.


### Day 9: September 15, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Watched some Fun Fun Function videos about dev habits and DevTips on what to learn next, jQuery, and how to keep up a web presence with my work.

**Thoughts** Feeling pretty sick and tired with a cold today so I'm taking it easy. Frustration is normal and it's there to help, gotta perservere. Have to make sure I'm not too bored or challenging myself to a point where I'm stressed. Find the "flow" state

### Day 10: September 16, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started random quote machine project from FreeCodeCamp. Learning about connecting to APIs using jQuery.

**Thoughts** Using jQuery AJAX shortcut since native JS is messy.

### Day 11: September 17, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Ch 2 of Eloquent JS.

**Thoughts** I like the vars to tentacles comparison.


### Day 12: September 18, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished random quote machine and added a color changing background.

**Thoughts** Need to work on more jQuery.

### Day 13: September 19, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Adjusted box transition in RQM, watched some DevTips videos on learning jQuery in 15 mins.

**Thoughts** Need to check out the "Killin it with jQuery" series.

### Day 14: September 20, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Watched DevTips bootstrap.

**Thoughts** Need to start working on coding earlier so I'm not so sleepy.


### Day 15: September 21, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript30 Day 1, drumkit.

**Thoughts** Need to figure out how to structure my learning with JS30 so that I'm applying myself more. Coding with him doesn't seem to work.


### Day 16: September 22, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Eloquent JS chapter 3.

### Day 17: September 23, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: JS clock for Javascript30 Day 2.

**Thoughts** I'm trying to recreate the start files to challenge myself with these projects more. Maybe I'll make a digital clock after I'm done working through the analog clock exercise.


### Day 18: September 24, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the JS clock.

**Thoughts** Shouldn't work in codepen for JS projects in the future.


### Day 19: September 25, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Made a digital JS clock from what I learned from the analog JavaScript30 clock.

**Thoughts** Need to get my portfolio site up so I can start hosting this stuff somewhere for feedback. Or at least get a blog coded out to use with the domain to share my code. Today was super fun and I think I really solidified my knowledge of what we worked on for JS30 day 2.


### Day 20: September 26, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Starting watching Fun Fun Function object creation playlist.

**Thoughts** Working on getting fundamentals solid so that I fully understand what I'm doing with JavaScript.


### Day 21: September 27, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Working on adding a button to change between 24 and 12 hour clock.

**Thoughts** It's frustrating to have to ask for so much help. It takes away from the feeling of accomplishment at the end of a project because I feel like it's not even me doing it, but I don't know how to bridge the knowledge gap when I literally have no idea where to go from a problem point. 


### Day 22: September 29, Friday

**Today's Progress**: JS30 Day 3, learning about CSS variables and JS.

**Thoughts** Now I know the difference between NodeList and arrays (they're just different types of objects with different methods attached to them). Learned more about template literals vs. concatenation.
<br>The control of CSS using JS variables could be cool to use for a colorblind profile on a website. Or user customizable stuff for themes and things.


### Day 23: September 30, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Fun Fun Function videos on prototypes and how "new" works under the hood.

**Thoughts** Need to revisit this, maybe try  to use it. Had trouble understanding.


### Day 24: October 1, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started Hacktoberfest with some UX enhancements, jQuery show/hide, code cleanup.

**Thoughts** Excited about my first PR ever on GitHub. I like the exposure to other people's code, too, it'll be important to have that skill when I start job searching.



### Day 25: October 2, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Looking at CodePens and working on hamburger menus.

**Thoughts** Need to learn CSS transforms and animations...


### Day 26: October 4, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Made a set of transforming hamburger menus using a YouTube tutorial and inspiration from other CodePens.

**Thoughts** Now I need to learn 3D animations!

### Day 27: October 5, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Wrestled SVGs

**Thoughts** Trying to learn differen methods of creating hamburger menus and animating. Someone on twitter suggested SVGs because they don't have any artifacting, having trouble animating them.


### Day 28: October 6, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Wrestled SVGs some more.

**Thoughts** Read an article about transforms and worked with the jQuery to make the click function more concise.


### Day 29: October 8, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Second PR for Hacktoberfest, working with JS

**Thoughts** Changed default to hide adult content on Anime Today site, toggled button text.

# 100 Days Of Code - Round 1 Log

### Day 1: September 7, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Did a lot of reading. Created a random password generator with Javascript to get back in the swing of things.

**Thoughts** I will not let imposter syndrome overwhelm me this time!

### Day 2: September 8, Friday

**Today's Progress**: "Gathering context" with ABC course, learned about Vue.js.

**Thoughts** Vue.js is really fast and easy to set up.

### Day 3: September 9, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about JS event loop, FreeCodeCamp factorialize a number exercise (not using recursion)

**Thoughts** I'd like to try to redo the factorial exercise with recursion and learn more about that.

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 4: September 10, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Redid FreeCodeCamp with recursion. Worked a FreeCodeCamp regular expressions problem.

**Thoughts**: Recursion reminds me a little of JS event loop in the way that it goes all the way into something and then all the way back out. "There's nothing that HAS to be solved with recursion." Regular expressions are really challenging right now, so I need to revisit eventually.

### Day 5-6: September 12, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through more FreeCodeCamp basic algorithm writing and read Chapter 1 of Problem Solving 101.

**Thoughts**: Had some frustration today during algorithm practice. I think Problem Solving 101 will be a good way to get into a permanent, whole mindset of problem solving.


### Day 7: September 13, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Rejoined Treehouse and started the React basics course. Also read Chapter 1 of Eloquent JS.

**Thoughts** There's a lot more to Javascript than I realized, Eloquent JS will be a good way to expose myself to some computer science information I may not otherwise see.

**Link(s) to work**
1. [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html)


### Day 8: September 14, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued React.js course on Treehouse.

**Thoughts** React's layout is very different from any other language or framework I've seen. Interested to learn more.


### Day 9: September 15, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Watched some Fun Fun Function videos about dev habits and DevTips on what to learn next, jQuery, and how to keep up a web presence with my work.

**Thoughts** Feeling pretty sick and tired with a cold today so I'm taking it easy. Frustration is normal and it's there to help, gotta perservere. Have to make sure I'm not too bored or challenging myself to a point where I'm stressed. Find the "flow" state

**Link(s) to work**
1. [RQM Codepen](https://goo.gl/3u5kDV)


### Day 14: September 20, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Watched DevTips bootstrap.

**Thoughts** Need to start working on coding earlier so I'm not so sleepy.


### Day 15: September 21, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript30 Day 1, drumkit.

**Thoughts** Need to figure out how to structure my learning with JS30 so that I'm applying myself more. Coding with him doesn't seem to work.


### Day 16: September 22, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Eloquent JS chapter 3.

### Day 17: September 23, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: JS clock for Javascript30 Day 2.

**Thoughts** I'm trying to recreate the start files to challenge myself with these projects more. Maybe I'll make a digital clock after I'm done working through the analog clock exercise.


### Day 18: September 24, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the JS clock.

**Thoughts** Shouldn't work in codepen for JS projects in the future.


### Day 19: September 25, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Made a digital JS clock from what I learned from the analog JavaScript30 clock.

**Thoughts** Need to get my portfolio site up so I can start hosting this stuff somewhere for feedback. Or at least get a blog coded out to use with the domain to share my code. Today was super fun and I think I really solidified my knowledge of what we worked on for JS30 day 2.


### Day 20: September 26, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Starting watching Fun Fun Function object creation playlist.

**Thoughts** Working on getting fundamentals solid so that I fully understand what I'm doing with JavaScript.


### Day 21: September 27, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Working on adding a button to change between 24 and 12 hour clock.

**Thoughts** It's frustrating to have to ask for so much help. It takes away from the feeling of accomplishment at the end of a project because I feel like it's not even me doing it, but I don't know how to bridge the knowledge gap when I literally have no idea where to go from a problem point. 


### Day 22: September 29, Friday

**Today's Progress**: JS30 Day 3, learning about CSS variables and JS.

**Thoughts** Now I know the difference between NodeList and arrays (they're just different types of objects with different methods attached to them). Learned more about template literals vs. concatenation.
<br>The control of CSS using JS variables could be cool to use for a colorblind profile on a website. Or user customizable stuff for themes and things.


### Day 23: September 30, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Fun Fun Function videos on prototypes and how "new" works under the hood.

**Thoughts** Need to revisit this, maybe try  to use it. Had trouble understanding.


### Day 24: October 1, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started Hacktoberfest with some UX enhancements, jQuery show/hide, code cleanup.

**Thoughts** Excited about my first PR ever on GitHub. I like the exposure to other people's code, too, it'll be important to have that skill when I start job searching.



### Day 25: October 2, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Looking at CodePens and working on hamburger menus.

**Thoughts** Need to learn CSS transforms and animations...


### Day 26: October 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Made a set of transforming hamburger menus using a YouTube tutorial and inspiration from other CodePens.

**Thoughts** Now I need to learn 3D animations!

2. [Hamburger Menu CodePen](https://t.co/yRWJP5DP17)


### Day 27: October 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Wrestled SVGs

**Thoughts** Trying to learn differen methods of creating hamburger menus and animating. Someone on twitter suggested SVGs because they don't have any artifacting, having trouble animating them.


### Day 28: October 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Wrestled SVGs some more.

**Thoughts** Read an article about transforms and worked with the jQuery to make the click function more concise.


### Day 29: October 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Second PR for Hacktoberfest, working with JS

**Thoughts** Changed default to hide adult content on Anime Today site, toggled button text.



### Day 30: October 8, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Third PR for Hacktoberfest, working with JS

**Thoughts** Update link in Github Favorites extension to direct to org and repo seperately.


### Day 31: October 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Fourth PR for Hacktoberfest, UX and copy changes. Also started work on portfolio site

**Thoughts** Looked at a guy's portfolio site and made some changes to links and HTML. Updating copy to make it more approachable. For portfolio, need to get a solid design down and then start coding it out.


### Day 32: October 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Sidebar exploration for portfolio navigation on codepen.

**Thoughts** Need to take some time outside of coding to design portfolio.

**Link(s) to work**
1. [Sidebar codepen](https://codepen.io/mdt2/pen/oGyjPb?editors=1100)



### Day 33: October 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Watching coding videos.

**Thoughts** Too tired for anything else tonight. Busy week at school. Feeling unmotivated today.


### Day 34: October 12, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Inspired by an article about program thinking to create a sidebar that opens on click.

**Thoughts** I want to make a library from this for sidebars and put it on GitHub!

**Link(s) to work**
1. [Article that inspired me](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-3ae955d414cd)


### Day 35: October 13, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked a bit on the sidebar before classes


### Day 36: October 14, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started making the sidebar dynamic.

**Thoughts** Added functions to detect height of screen, adding list items, styling the list items. Wondering why you can't have one function and pass parameters for all styling. Because if you have color and font size, you have to pass both parameters, you can't just pass one that you want to change...


### Day 37: October 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: More drawer work.

**Thoughts** Finished up all the helper functions like adding list items and styling them. Just made separate functions for all of them.


### Day 38: October 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**: More drawer work, using a builder pattern to make it more like a library.

**Thoughts** Refactoring code and fixing bugs that arose with the builder pattern.


### Day 39: October 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the drawer and put it on GitHub!

**Thoughts** I want to do more open source, this was a good way to practice JS.


### Day 40: October 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Read some articles on licensing, ES7, ES6 generators.

**Thoughts** Should spend more time reading.


### Day 41: October 20, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Started learning canvas.

**Thoughts** I want to learn to do cool stuff like in the CodePen below:

**Links** 
1. [Canvas codepen](https://codepen.io/valhead/pen/NABYow?editors=0010)

### Day 42: October 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: More work on canvas, going through game dev tutorials.

**Thoughts** I want to learn to do cool stuff like in the CodePen below:

**Links** 
1. [Game dev tutorial](http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/)
2. [My codepen for the tutorial](https://codepen.io/mdt2/pen/MERmoE?editors=0010)


### Day 43: October 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: More work on canvas, canvas paint tool.

**Links** 
1. [Paint tool](https://codepen.io/mdt2/pen/QqPoPZ)


### Day 44: October 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed context stuff, like event loop and scope and hoisting.

### Day 45: October 25, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: More JS fundamentals work, learning about closures.

**Thoughts** Confused about why they're so important. I think I'm starting to grasp it as I slowly work through this article:

**Links** 
1. [JS Closures](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/lets-learn-javascript-closures-66feb44f6a44)

### Day 46: October 30, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Watched a few JavaScript30 videos. Learning about hsl() and gaining more understanding about template literals. Also went over some handy tools to use in the console. Read an article about APIs and was confused.

**Thoughts** I got off track for a few days because of Halloween and plans and the football game. I was also really discouraged when I heard a girl in a similar position to me wasn't even being acknowledged by any of the junior dev jobs she applied to. I can't let that stop me though, going to keep on chugging through the rest of this challenge.


### Day 47: October 31, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript30 flexbox video and checkbox shift video. Signed up for Wes's full flexbox course to try to master that.

**Thoughts** The checkbox shift video was difficult. Wes asked us to try it ourselves first, so I did some searching and found the answer, but it didn't make any sense to me. I had to watch the whole video to know where to go next. How do you tackle a JS problem when you don't even know where to start?


### Day 48: November 1, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Flexbox zombies as recommended by Andrew! Went over flex-direction and justify-content

**Thoughts** I always get confused when I want to use flexbox because I have to look back at the docs every time. This course seems like it will actually hold true to it's promise that I'll never have to look at docs for flexbox again. Loving the mastery learning approach.

**Links**
1. [Flexbox zombies](https://t.co/V327jBC0v9)


### Day 49: November 2, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Flexbox zombies continued, also talked jobs with Andrew and read an article on Medium about how to prepare for dev job interviews

**Thoughts** I should start practicing the front end questions on the GitHub repo

**Links**

### Day 50: November 3, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Flexbox zombies continued. Also did a CodeWars square number challenge.

**Thoughts** CodeWars intimidates me a lot and I'm not sure why.


### Day 51: November 4, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Flexbox zombies continued. More algorithm design with CodeWars.

**Thoughts** I figured out why CodeWars intimidates me. It's because algorithm design is such a different way of thinking for me, but one that I really need to practice.


### Day 52: November 5, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Extra flexbox zombies.

**Thoughts** Almost finished. I went back over a few lessons to make sure I really remember everything.


### Day 53: November 6, Monday

**Today's Progress**: More flexbox zombies. Also read some Medium articles about getting junior dev job ready and found a guide on GitHub.

**Thoughts** I'm going to start working through this guide. My goal is to have at least half of it completed by the end of this round of 100DaysOfCode.

**Links**
1. [Guide on GitHub](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready.md)


### Day 54: November 7, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished flexbox zombies and started coding portfolio site!

**Thoughts** Got all done with the landing page. Faced some challenges with positioning and flexbox and figured out how those work together (need a position:relative wrapper div around the display:flex and position:absolute flexbox div). Explore a normalize.css tomorrow that Austin told me about?

### Day 55: November 9, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on portfolio site coding and helped Amanda and Katie do some coding on their own portfolio sites.

**Thoughts** Starting working on the work page and ran into some sizing issues with flexbox that were challenging. But I got that all figured out. Need to look into a CSS slider to show to Katie for her portfolio site. Hoping I can learn it and then teach her to solidify the learning.

### Day 56: November 10, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on portfolio site coding more.

**Thoughts** Finished up the work section.

### Day 57: November 11, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on portfolio site coding.

**Thoughts** Finished up the desktop version, need to go back and add button functionality and media queries where it isn't automatically responsive.

### Day 58: November 12, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about CSS Grids.

**Thoughts** Read an article comparing it to flexbox and finished Grid Garden. Wasn't a huge fan of it, I don't think it does as good a job as it could as far as making you really learn it and understand what you're doing. I also couldn't see many actual applications from the game, but the article helped show me that.

**Links**
1. [CSS Grids vs Flexbox article](https://aerolab.co/blog/flexbox-grids/?ref=webdesignernews.com)


### Day 59: November 14, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Back to portfolio coding. Added functionality to the button with JS and found a way to do a smooth scroll between sections.

**Thoughts** The fact that you can't add an href to a button element is confusing. Also not happy with the smooth scroll, but my headache is so bad I just can't continue tonight.

### Day 60: November 16, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up adding media queries and debugging portfolio site. Set up hosting on AWS with S3 and added Google Analytics to the page.

**Thoughts** Need to share on Twitter in a couple of days when the DNS is all set. 

### Day 61: November 17, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Switched media queries over to mixins with sass.

**Thoughts** Mixins are cool and they forced me to be really picky about where I set my breakpoints. Interested in adding some very subtle paralax for desktop experience to make background changes smoother. Looks too harsh, especially where portfolio meets about.

**Links**: [100% correct way to do media queries](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-100-correct-way-to-do-css-breakpoints-88d6a5ba1862)

### Day 62: November 21, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started the CS50 course on edX as recommended by the p1xt job ready javascript edition.

**Thoughts** Need to schedule coding time in earlier in the day. Too sleepy.

### Day 63: November 22, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished week 0 of CS50, working with logic with Scratch.

**Thoughts** Not a huge fan of Scratch since I'm already familiar, but it was a good way to practice some psuedo coding.

**Links**
1. [Squirrel game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/188187151)

### Day 64: November 23, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started week 1 lecture of CS50.

**Thoughts** I can't wait for winter break so that I can spend more time coding.

### Day 65: November 24, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued week 1 lecture and made updates to portfolio site.

**Thoughts** Thinking about changing the design of my portfolio site to incorporate more contrast between sections.

### Day 66: November 26, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished week 1 lecture for CS50. Learning about how code goes from what I write to binary through preprocessing, compiling, assembling, and linking. Started watching Cassidy William's JS and React course on Udemy.

### Day 67: November 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Read an article on HTML emails and accessibility, and one on Netflix replacing React on their marketing page, both via CSS tricks. Then looked at the problem set for week 1 CS50 and skipped on to start the week 2 lecture.

**Thoughts** I should go back and do the problem set for week 1 when I have more energy. So much due at the end of the semester :(

### Day 68: November 28, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked for a few hours on problem set 1. Almost finished it but the "greedy" exercise stumped me. Going to finish tomorrow.

**Thoughts** Hopefully I'll get some help from a fellow 100daysofcode participant by the time I pick it up again tomorrow. I think the problem is where I'm trying to turn a float into an integer and round it. I don't think I'm doing it right.

### Day 69: November 29, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished up problem set 1 and started lecture for week 2.

**Thoughts** I wish I'd known the debugging stuff that he talked about in week 2's lecture while I was struggling with "greedy," but it will be good to know moving forward.

### Day 70: November 30, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished lecture for week 1 and redesigned and recoded the portfolio part of the site.

**Thoughts** Being able to pass more than one int in a for loop was new and interesting to me. Something like for (int i = 0, n = strlen; i < n; i++) works more effectively than passing strlen in the second argument because you're not asking the computer to count the length every time the loop iterates.

### Day 71: December 1, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Made CSS Grid on my portfolio section responsive.

**Thoughts** This was tough. I'm glad I used Grid to get an idea of how it works but there are lots of quirks. Like how I couldn't get grid-gap to work with a percentage for the rows, but it worked with a percentage on the columns. Frustrating, but finally got everything all set. Collaborated with Austin a lot to figure out the problems and think through logically what was going on.
